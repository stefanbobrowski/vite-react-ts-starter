# Vite + React + TypeScript – Starter Template

Built with:

- ⚡ Vite (with SWC for fast builds)
- ⚛️ React 19
- 🧠 TypeScript
- 🎨 SCSS + CSS Modules
- 🎯 React Router
- 🛠️ ESLint + Prettier + EditorConfig

3. ✅ **SASS (SCSS)** with modular file support
4. ✅ **CSS Modules** for scoped and safe styles
5. ✅ **Global CSS Reset**
